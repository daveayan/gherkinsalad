 * Unless absolutely needed do not use this class directly. Use the daveayan.gherkinsalad.BaseAutomationObject object instead.
 * Use this method to initialize a browser instance, launch it, close it and navigate to a specific url. This class is built such that
 * only one running instance of browser can be handled. For example:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Browser firefox = Browser.instance_of("Firefox");
 * firefox.launch();
 * 
 * Browser chrome = Browser.instance_of("Chrome");
 * chrome.launch();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This will suspend the firefox browser and let the chrome browser take control.
